This report pulls various csv files that contain AQI_VALUE, CO AQI Value, Ozone AQI Value, NO2 AQI Value, and various other metrics regarding air quality.

In addition, I also wanted to analyze AQI data with datasets that provide census data on country population, GDP, GDP Growth etc
in order to see if there can be any correlations drawn in the power bi report from these two different categories of data sets. Country, continent, GDP 
and census data was pulled from UN datasets

Python, numpy, pandas was used with jupyternotebooks to append datasets together, create primary keys, and clean bad datasets

SQL objects was created in Microsoft SQL Server and direct imported into the power bi data model
